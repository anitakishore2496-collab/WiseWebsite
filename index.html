      <strong>Important Notice:</strong><br />
      TheWiseSphere provides preliminary, educational decision-support only.
      A licensed Professional Engineer is required to prepare, seal, and sign
      all final studies, designs, and documents, with approval from the Authority

    <h2>What TheWiseSphere Helps You Understand</h2>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Early Feasibility</h3>
        <p>
          Explore potential traffic and access impacts before investing in full
          engineering studies or permit submittals.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Scenario Awareness</h3>
        <p>
          Compare development scenarios to understand how changes in access,
          scale, or context may affect review complexity.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Risk Framing</h3>
        <p>
          Identify common triggers, review sensitivities, and areas that
          frequently require mitigation or variance consideration.
        </p>

    <h2>What This Platform Does Not Do</h2>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          ❌ Provide engineering advice or professional judgment<br />
          ❌ Certify compliance or permit approval<br />
          ❌ Replace licensed consultants or agency review<br />
          ❌ Issue stamped or sealed documents
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <p>
          ✔ Support informed discussions with consultants<br />
          ✔ Improve preparedness before agency coordination<br />

  <!-- CONSULTANT CONNECTION -->
  <section>
    <h2>Connecting With Licensed Professionals</h2>

    <p>
      When you are ready to proceed beyond preliminary exploration,
      engagement with an independent, licensed traffic engineering consultant
      is required.
    </p>

    <p>
      If desired, TheWiseSphere can assist in facilitating connections to
      nearby, licensed traffic engineering consultants. Any services,
      advice, or professional work provided by such consultants are
      independent of TheWiseSphere.
